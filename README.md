# ReFactor
Project Title
This project is about refactoring the previous code used to establish a website titled Website. Refactoring started from finding the relevant title name to the website up to enriching the code with the semantic HTML by and following the logical structure of elements.

Motivation
Nowadays it is not possible to find things in a static position. We have been living in a dynamic world. So we have to update ourselves, review, and if necessary refactor ours and others' output. In the coding industry, there are no stand-alone and untouchable products. It is all about giving and taking across the developers. I am on my way to join the journey and villages of a developer. Through the process, reviewing and refactoring codes is one of the opportunities to learn from and put my fingerprints as much as possible.

Actions taken to adderss the problem
As much as possible refactoring a code by incorporating descriptive elements called semantic elements. Semantic elements are clearly describing their meaning for both the browser and a developer than non-semantic elements.
Bringing together those sections that do have the same appearance and feature.
I recommend a better title name rather than using common names like "Website".
I tried to cluster a bunch of syntax, properties, and values into a one or a minimized format particularly in the styling work,
### Lesson learned
Once a code is developed by a developer it is not an end, rather it is a beginning to enrich it for a better output.
Whatever code you developed or refactor it is better to have a broad perspective.
A better understanding of the importance, difference, and meaning of semantic and non-semantic elements.
